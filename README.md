# Council Bin Service
Various applications with querying bin schedule from ArsBorough webservice - more of an adapter and chance to build a simple webapi with a vague purpose

## Console App

- currently queries based on config settings and dumps a vaguely formatted output

## REST API

- api endpoint adapter meant to provide a REST API interface as an alternative to the webservice API
